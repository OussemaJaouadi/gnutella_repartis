> ### Query flooding 
> **Fully distributed**
>   * No central server
>   * Peers contact a few nodes to become neighbours
>   * Search: peers ask neighbors, who ask their neighbors
>   * Peers get files directly from other nodes
>
> ### Advantages
>   * Fully decentralized
>   * Search cost distributed
>   * Processing per node permits powerful search semantics
>
> ### Disadvantages
>   * Search scope may be quite large
>   * Search time may be quite long
>   * High overhead, and nodes come and go often
